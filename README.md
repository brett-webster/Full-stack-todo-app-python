### Objective

Your challenge is to build out this full-stack todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

Using any language or framework (our team mostly works in React and Python/Flask), your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Client Side**

Your users should be able to:

-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

**Server Side**

-   Design a simple API for persisting state on the server side
-   Implement routes for all listed **CRUD** operations
-   **No authentication / session management is required.** Imagine you're building this application for a single user (yourself)

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   **Testing:** is the system adequately tested? **Please write at least one unit test.**
-   **Completeness:** did you complete the features?
-   **Correctness:** does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   **Maintainability:** is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the main branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
